Created some hierarchical tiddlers today. Don't quite understand tagging; it feels backwards to me. I created the tiddler [[Summer 2015]]. I then created, using the {{{new here}}}  tool, a tiddler for summer projects, and then one tiddler for each of the summer projects. But looking a [[Summer 2015]] none of the structure is visible. So must have to change the template or something. That's my journal!
